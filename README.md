# Algorithms

A list of algorithms to know, to study and to practice.

The main source is coming from: https://cp-algorithms.com . They are then translated from C++ to Java, and test data are added to them.

They may also come from different websites, or from books (if so, specified inside in the comment of the first line).

Feel free to add more algorithms to the list.
